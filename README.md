<h1 align=center>CI/CD pipeline of deployment 2 </h2>

This deployment will provide all the necessary steps that you will need to successfully set up a CI/CD pipeline from start to finish where a flask application will be built, tested, and deployed. 
Elastic Beanstalk will be used to deploy the application and you will be charged accordingly for customizing the pipeline.

Please refer to the documentation for the steps (https://github.com/cceliuss187/Deployment-2/blob/main/Deployment_2%20Document.md) to complete this deployment.

Good Luck! :+1:
